* Blood donation is the only method to secure accessibility of blood products for patients in need of transfusion and accessibility is solely dependent on voluntary non-remunerated blood donors.
* Many countries' health authorities and blood centers are striving to have sufficient blood donations to secure a stable blood supply in the country or region.
* In this case study, we aimed to find features that could help improve blood donation performance in South Korea.
* The objective of this case study is as follows:
  * Analyze the trend of blood donations in South Korea since 2005 
  * Identify which features have a significant impact on high blood donation
  * Recommendations for blood centers to increase blood donation
* To identify important features, we built various machine-learning models from simple Logistic Regression to the XGBoosting Classifier model.
* Platforms used for this project
  * Python: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Xgboost
  * Visualization: Tableau, Seaborn
## Project Outline
1. Plan Stage: Data collection, Data dictionary, Pre-processing & Feature engineering
2. Analyze Stage: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Construct Stage: Prepare, Construct, and train & test models 
4. Execute Stage: Interpret model performance, conclusion (recommendation)

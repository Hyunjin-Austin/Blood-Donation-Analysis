* Blood donation is the only method to secure accessibility of blood products for patients in need of transfusion and accessibility is solely dependent on voluntary blood donation. Hence, many countries' health authorities and blood centers are striving to have sufficient blood donations to secure a stable blood supply in the country or region.
* However, securing sufficient blood inventory is facing challenges for several reasons. In this case study, we aimed to find features that could help high blood donation in South Korea.
* The objective of this case study is as follows:
  * Analyze the trend of blood donations since 2005
  * Identify which features have an impact on blood donation rate
  * Recommendations for blood centers to increase blood donation rate
* To identify which features are important, we built various machine-learning models from simple Logistic Regression to the XGBoosting Classifier model.
* Through the project, we selected key features that impact high performance.
* Note for this project
  * The data used for this project is entirely from public data, extracted from KOSIS
  * This case study is based on blood donation data from the Korean National Red Cross
  * This project is co-established with **Yoojin (Audrey) Jung**, a data analyst specialist from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
    * (Skills) Data Analytics, Visualization (Tableau), SQL, R, Python

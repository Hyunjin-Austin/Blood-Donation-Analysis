* Blood donation is the only method to secure accessibility of blood products for patients in need of transfusion and accessibility is solely dependent on voluntary blood donation.
* However, the total population in South Korea is currently declining adding challenges to maintaining the blood donation rate
* The objective of this case study is as follows:
  * Analyze the trend of blood donations since 2005
  * Identify which features have an impact on blood donation rate
  * Recommendations for blood centers to increase blood donation rate
* To identify which features are important, we built various machine-learning models from simple Logistic Regression to the XGBoosting Classifier model.
* Through the project, we selected key features that impact high performance.
* Note for this project
  * The data used for this project is entirely from public data, extracted from KOSIS
  * This case study is based on blood donation data from the Korean National Red Cross
  * This project is co-established with **Yoojin (Audrey) Jung**, a data analyst specialist from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
    * (Skills) Data Analytics, Visualization (Tableau), SQL, R, Python
